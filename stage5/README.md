Step 5: The secret message (THE FINAL STEP!)

Step live from: Wednesday April 24th 5 pm Eagle Time (6 pm CET/5 pm BST/noon ET/9 am PT)

Today is DNA Day, which is celebrated annually to celebrate the discovery of the double helix. On this day, April 25th, 60 years ago, Watson and Crick published their proposed structure of DNA in Nature. The model was largely based on X-ray diffraction data generated at King's College, which was co-published with the double helix model in two accompanying papers.

In today's Genome Biology, we speak to the last surviving member of the King's team, Raymond Gosling, and hear his account of how the structure came to be discovered. Gosling highlights three unsung heroes: John Randall, Rudolf Signer andâ€¦serendipity! You can read the article in full here, or here a clip of the interview, in which Gosling describes a memorable moment between Rosalind Franklin and Jim Watson, at Biome, here.

 Ray Gosling: double helix legend

Gosling was a little disappointed when the double helix failed to have the immediate impact he hoped for, and drifted away from the biological realm altogether. He might therefore be interested to read the second piece we have put together for DNA60, in which a selection of Genome Biology's Editorial Board members highlight the big landmark moments of the sixty years of genome biology kick-started by the double helix. For those without a subscription, you can find out what the most popular choice was, and also read an excerpt (featuring the thoughts of Ford Doolittle and Steven Henikoff), over at Biome.

The challenge

For the final! challenge, aka Step 5, we return to the format used at our Beyond The Genome conferences. A secret message* has been embedded into an unknown genome using the encoding scheme developed by Church, Gao and Kosuri (see the provided set of instructions and scripts for more details). Your task is to identify the genome, identify the insertion, and then decode the insertion to arrive at the quote, ie the secret message.

Contestants who have identified the quote should email it immediately to dna60ifx@gmail.com. The first correct answer received wins an iPad, and two runners-up win their choice of a Beyond The Genome registration or a year's Genome Biology subscription.

* we note without comment that the University of Cambridge, where Watson and Crick built their double helix model, has a notorious association with espionage
